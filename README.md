# UVA-OnlineJudge-Submissions

I took a course during my University studies called Advanced Programming, where the assignments where to complete a set of UVA Online Judge problems.
I took the opportunity to try to complete all of them in Python, since I wanted to improve and gain more experience with the language.

However, one of the problems, 185 - Roman Numerals, I never managed to solve in Python, but was able to so in C++.
My solution of this problem uses iterators to explore permutations, which I struggled to find an aefficient way of doing in Python.
