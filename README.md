# UVA-OnlineJudge-Submissions

I tried solving some problems on UVA-OnlineJudge in Python, since I wanted to improve and gain more experience with the language.

However, one of the problems, 185 - Roman Numerals, I never managed to solve in Python, but was able to so in C++.
My solution of this problem uses iterators to explore permutations, which I struggled to find an efficient way of doing in Python.
